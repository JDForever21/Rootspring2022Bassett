        <h2>My Biography</h2>
        <p>My name is Jordan Bassett. I am 19 years old and I enjoy making art both digitally and traditionally. I enjoy sketching cartoons, as well as creating my own cartoons. I also enjoy using Adobe Softwares such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and more! I believe that anyone who wants to create art can do it if they put their minds to it. So why not try for an hour or two? What could it hurt?</p>
