    <p style="color:white;"> Last but not least, my favorite character to visit at Disney is Pluto! He was adorable 
        when seeing him just like in the Mickey Mouse show. Growing up, Pluto was my favorite
        because he was the only non talking dog on the show which made it realistic for 
        and easier for me to believe that he was real.
