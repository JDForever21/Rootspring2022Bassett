    <p style="color:white;">Another one of the old, but goodies is Buzz Lightyear. With his soaring through the sky, Buzz Lightyear 
    comes out once in a blue moon to say hello to the kids. With him being a toy, when someones says,
"Andy's coming!", all the gang fall to the floor and act as if they're toys again just like
in the movies. What a good memory for those who grew up with him. To end this character, we shall say
his special catchphrase. "To infinity and beyond!"</p>
