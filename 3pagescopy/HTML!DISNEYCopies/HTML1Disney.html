    <p style="color: white;">When visiting Disney World last Wednesday, it was a must that I go and 
    see at least one Disney character. Whether it was in the parade,
or a surprise visit at a resort, it was imposibble not to see
at least one while visiting. So, we are gonna explore and go through my three
favortie Disney characters when going to Disney World.<p>

    <p style="color:white;">Stitch is such an adorable character seen in the movie "Lilo and Stitch". Growing up, it was a movie like I had never seen before. 
    I always wanted to have a dog/alien like him, but got sad news when told he didn't 
actually exist. However, he is real when seen at Disney. I saw him at Disney and took pictures with him. 
He was energetic just like in the movies. It was an amazing experience that I wish
to give to my future children.</p>
